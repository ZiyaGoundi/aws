Cloud computing : you are using someone else computer. 

Definition of Cloud Computing : Cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive.

NIST Definition of Cloud Computing : 
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Pay-as-go ==> Pay for the resources you are actually using.. 
if you are using a server for 5 min, you will get charged for 5 min only.. 


On-demand self-service : you can choose what service you want to use. you will get charged for the resources you are actually using. you no need to depend on service provider to get these things done.

Rapid elasticity : We can easily Upgrade and downgrade the resources. it wont take much time to perform. 
Example : We can launch server with very small config, if required we can upgrade same server to very high configuration. No need to sped lot of time. no need to worry about hardware dependencies.


t2.micro	: 1 CPU, 1 RAM 
medium		: 2 CPU, 4 RAM
xlarge		: 4 CPU, 16 RAM


Measured Services : Whatever you use, the usage will be measured. (per gb/month, /hr, /sec)

Broad network access & High Availability : Cloud service providers has infra almost across the globe. Instead of spending time and building our own infra, we can use this cloud providers infra and deliver our application quickly.

Resource pooling. : You can use cloud shared tenancy mechanism to save cost. Underlying resources share with multiple customers.

----------------

Pay-as-you-go : pay for the resources you are actually using. 

You used a server for 1 hr in a day = 1 hr cost..

----------------

DEPLOYMENT MODELS :

Public cloud : THis model is open for everyone. Anyone can create an accont and start using. 
Azure, GCP, AWS..  Maintenance : Service provider responsibility. 

Private cloud  : Not open for everyone, Dedicated for only one organisation.  Only that org users / only authorised uses can use. Maint: Your team can fix it / you can take assistance from 3rd party.

Hybrid cloud : Combination of one or more cloud deployment models.. Public + public / Public + private
Existing Servers + creting new svrs in AWS..  Azure + AWS.. 
==> Site-to-site VPN connection, AWS Direct Connect

Community cloud : group of org build the infra together and only that group of org use that infra. main : One of the org from group / 3rd party.

Service models of Cloud Computing : 

-> IaaS : We need takes care about the OS level onwords. No need to take care about Physical resources.

-> PaaS : Platform as a Service : Moderate efforts.. Our efforts is to design application only, not infra management / configuration management.

-> SaaS : Software as a Service : No efforts / very very less efforts.




Fully furnished apartment : SaaS
Apartment : PaaS
Am giving you piece of land, you have to build everything : IaaS

you purchase land and build your own house : on-remise



Order : SaaS
Dining in rest : PaaS
cooking in existing kitchen : IaaS

Build your kitchen then cook : 


Requirement : I need a website that can be accesable across the globe.!



Self Managed/on-Premise : 

SaaS : Software as a Service : Lightsail : Create and deliver.. (customize if required)
PaaS : Platform as a Service : AWS Elastic beanstalk.. provide my data.. and deliver my website..
IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service : launch ec2 instance/Server.. install webserver.. and create data to deliver..

AWS Is a Cloud Service Provider. AWS provides the required infra to organisations to deliver their application. 
Pay-as-go method : pay for the resources you actually uses.

AWS Timeline : 


S3 : Simple Storage Service : This is AWS version of Google Drive. 

EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : Service to launch and run Servers. 

RDS : Relational Datbase Service : We can create and manage databases. 


Static : Fixed, Wont change
Dynamic : Changesbased on requests. 

================================================================================================

AWS Global Infra : 

Region : It don't have any technical definition. Its jus a physical or geographical location AWS segregated.
As of June, We have 33 regions across the globe.

==> Every region has multiple AZs.

AZ / Availability zone: AZ is nothing but a Data Centre or combination of multiple DCs. 
Why multiple AZs in a region : For Redundancy purpose and FT/Fault tolarance purpose.

We have 105 AZs at movement.

Mumbai : 3 AZ
hyd : 3 AZ

PoP Locations / Edge Location : It works with CDN mechanism (Content Deliver network)..
Instead of delivering all data/requests from origin, Data will be cached and delivered from customer nearby location. 
600+ PoP location as of June 2024.
