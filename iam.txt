Root User : Unrestricted access on AWS account.
** We dont use this user for day-to-day activities.

Highly recommended to Enable "2/multi factor Authentication" for root user.


IAM User : We always follow "Least privilages mechanism". Using IAM service, We can create users, groups and we can manage user accesses on AWS resources.
-> provide permissions/access that really reqwuired to perform his job duties.
-> 

Storage Administration : IAM User with Username and password : Add permissions to access only Storage


User : Only S3 Access
User : Only ec2 access
User : Provide read only access

Root user : When ever you are login using an email id and password, we call that user as "root user". 
==> Root user have unrestricted access on our AWS account.
==> Changing support plan / changing payment methods / closing aws account / transfer account.

We can secure this account by enabling MFA / 2-factor authentication.


IAM User : Identity and Access Management : In IAM, We can create users, groups and we can manage user permissions. 

Policy : Set of permissions on our AWS Services.

--> least privilages mechanism.


====



AWS Engineer
--> Ec2/server issues : Username & Password : Ec2fullaccess 
--> Database issues : Username & Password : RDS Full Access

Monitoring
--> Monitor aws resources.  , Fresher : Username & Password : ReadOnly

Enable Free Tier Alerts : Login to your aws account, Navihate to "Billing and Cost management", Navihate to "billing Preferences", Enable Alert preferences. Enter your email id.


=================

Root user : Unrestricted access on AWS account.

IAM user with Administrator Access : Almost similar permissions as root user, but he cannot perform account management related activities (account closing / changing support plan / changing payment methods/ Renaming account / changing email of account).


=================

Create an AWS account
Setup password standard and Account Alias for your AWS accounts.

Task 1 : create an IAM user, Add "S3FullAccess", login as this user and create a bucket. Now navigate to IAM service and try to create an IAM user and verify.!

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Add  "AdministratorAccess" policy. Login and try to access "Billing information". It will Deny. 
--> Provide Billing access to the above IAM user.??

Task 3 : create an IAM user, Add "EC2FullAccess", login as this user and try to create a bucket..

=========================================================================

Implicit Allow : We can access only the services allocated. If we try to access any other service, it will Deny.


Requirement : I have an IAM User, This user need all aws services access. But, i dont want to provide s3 full access for this user.??? 


Policy : Set of Permissions on our aws account. Policy writtens in JSON format.
--> AWS Managed - Job Function
--> AWS Managed Policy
--> Customer Managed Policy
__________________

Policy : Document contains set of permissions writtens in JSON format. Policy provide permissions on AWS resources for users/groups/roles.


--> AWS Managed Policy : Policy provided by AWS, Based on Service.
--> AWS managed - Job function policy : policy provided by AWS, It is a combination of multiple Services. AWS provided this based on some standard jobs available in market.
--> Customer Managed policy :  Based on customer requiremnent, he can create and manage.


Task : Create a policy to 'deny' s3.

Task 2 : Create an IAM user, provide him "AdministratorAccess" and associate "task 1 policy" to this user, login and try to create a bucket.!!!  
output..?

Task 3 : Create a Policy to allow S3FullACcess, but this should work from only one/your Network.
** You have to add an IP address condition.

policy simulator : We can simulate IAM user permissions and get information about the performing activity (allow/deny).


CloudTrail : Logging service in AWS. It logs everything (including refresh also).
--> Enabled by default. We dont have option disable it. 
--> Defaultly it can store last 90 days logs.


Credential report : It gives all IAM users last logged in, pwd expiration, creation data and accesskeys..


We will get an ARN : Amazon Resource Name, Unique identifier for our resource. 

arn:aws:iam::501170964283:user/Avinash_T
arn:aws:iam::501170964283:group/Admins
arn:aws:s3:::avinash


Inline : Not a reusable policy. We can apply policy for specific resource only (user, group or role). Hard to track this, Only in special occassions we use this inline policy.
--> To overcome the policy count limitations / character limitation, we can use this inline policy.


Permissions boundary : Set maximum permissions a user can get. 


===========

Task  : Create a custom policy to activate MFA for IAM users, He himself able to activate MFA. 
	Create an IAM user, provide S3FullAccess. Login as this user and Now try to "Activate MFA". It will give error. Fix this errors and allow him to activate MFA.


Task 2 : Create an IAM user, Want to provide "S3FullAccess" with our custom policy,  We need to restrict this user to work only on specific region (mumbai/ap-south-1).

Create a policy allow all s3 actions on all resources, Add a "region" condition.

==> Login as this user, Try to create bucket in "mumbai" it should allow. If you choose any other regions it should not allow.
