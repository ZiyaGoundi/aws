S3 : Simple Storage Service :
-
Object based storage :  We cannot install/run any applications/os. : Dropbox / GDrive 
--> Designed to flat files.

Block based storage : Designed to run OS, We can install/run applications.. : EBS, Instance store volumes. : EC2 
Storage over the network : Storage runs over the network and it can be mounted to multiple devices. : EFS, FSx : EC2

--> Designed to store objects. We can store any flat files.
--> We store data in BUCKETS.
--> Bucket names should be unique across the globe.
--> Defualtly, we can create 100 buckets, This is a soft limit. use "Service Quota" to incease this limit.
--> We can store unlimited data in a bucket.
--> No Pre-provisioning required.
--> Bucket naming limitations.
	--> Min char 3, Max 63 char length
	--> Bucket name should be in small , and numeric
	--> Bucket name should not start with .
	--> Should not end with . , No adjesent ..
	--> Bucket name should not resemble IP address format. (192.168.100.1)

--> We can upload objects to this buckets.
--> Min obj size : 0 bytes.. Max Obj size: 5 TB
--> S3 is now required region selection. You first need to choose a region, where you want to create your s3 bucket.
--> While creating bucket, we need to choose the region. Data physically resides at this regions AZs. 

https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname (standard URL)
https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)
https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname (virtual path)

Virtual paths won't work if we have . in bucket names.

To make an object public : 

1. Block Public Access settings for this account : Account Level Blocking
2. Block public access (bucket settings) : Bucket level Blocking
--> We should make an object public, then only Object URLs works.
** Object Ownership : ACLs enabled
3. Make object public. (Select object --> actions --> last option --> make public using acl)

S3 Free Tier ELigibility : 
5 GB Standard Storage
--> 2000 PUT (Upload) / 20,000 GET (Download)
_______________________________________________________________________________

Task :  In Your Personal Accounts:
--> Enable "Free tier alerts". Login using root user/iam user with admin permissions..
Preferences --> Billing preferences --> Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts --> Enable and enter valid email address.

Task 2 : Create an s3 bucket, Upload an object, Access the Object as an IAM user.

Make it public and access same object using public URL.

S3 Storage Classes : 

--> S3 Standard : Defualt storage class for all the data we upload to s3. Data will be available immedeatly.
Designed to store : Frequently accessed data. 
Availability : 99.99%,  Durability: 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Standard-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data
Avai : 99.9%, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> One Zone-IA : Data will be available immedeatly. Designed to store : infrequently accessed data. Store only non-critical data. Cost less than 40% compared to Standard-IA.
Avai : 99.5 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : 1 AZs

--> Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Formerly Glacier) : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (1 min - 5 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

--> Glacier Instant Retrieval : Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds. 

--> Glacier Deep Archieve : Long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from 12 hrs. Data won't be available immedeatly. We need to initiate a data restration to view the data. Restoration takes (5 - 12 Hrs)
Avai : 99.99 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs
..

S3 Intelligent Tier : If we have unknown access pattern, we can choose. 
Avai : 99.9 %, Durability : 99.999999999 (11 9's) 
Data replicates across : >= 3 AZs

RRS : Redused Redundancy Storage : Not Recommanded : Less durability.. 
Durability : 99.99%, As we have less durability we have high chances to loss the data when compared to another storage classes.


S3 Pricing : 
--> How much data we are storing.
--> How many GET/PUT operations (uploads/downloaded object count)
--> Data retrivals

S3 FREE TIER :
--> 5 GB Standard Storage
--> 2000 PUT Operations (upload)
--> 20,000 GET operation (open/download)

Glacier data retrival : 
Bulk retrieval : Typically within 5-12 hours.
Standard retrieval : Typically within 3-5 hours.
Expedited retrieval : Typically within 1-5 minutes when retrieving less than 250 MB.

** Only S3 standard comes under free tier eligibility.


------------

--> versioning helps us to get our data to correct state, AWS maintains multiple copies of our data.
--> If we accedentally overwrite any data or delete any file, we can get it to correct state.

If you are typing "Delete" ==> you'll get delete Marker. 
If you are typing "perm Delete" ==> You wont get Delete marker.

Delete the "Delete Marker" to get your object back.
_________

Version : AWS maintains multiple copies in s3 bucket. 
--> Defaultly versioning will be in Suspended state.

--> When versioning is enabled on bucket, If we delete an object

Versioning : HIDE
--> S3 will show most recent uploaded object only / Current version objects.
--> We will get a Delete Marker. 
--> TO get object back / undo delete, Set Version to SHOW, Delete the delete marker.

Versioning : SHOW
--> If we delete an object, it deletes permanently.

s3 standard : Designed to store frequrntly accessed data.  We can access data without any delays.
>=3 copies

Standard-IA (Infrequrntly Accessed) : Designed to store less frequrntly accessed data.  We can access data without any delays.
>=3 copies

OneZone-IA : Same as Standard-IA, but, AWS maintains only one copy of our data in backend.
1 copy

Glacier : Designed to archive data, We cannot access data immediatly. We have to initiate a data restoration to access data.

Intelligent Tier : When we are not sure about our access patterns..
